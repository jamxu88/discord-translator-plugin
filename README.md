# discord-translator-plugin
## An injected plugin + translation server for Discord to allow for quick, accurate translations with Deepl
- index.js: A Node.JS server to run on your localhost
- script.js: The script to inject into Discord (ctrl+shift+i -> console, copy + paste script in)
## Limitations: I am using Reqbin + Deepl as a free API endpoint, and it is very easily rate limited. Use a paid service to avoid this, such as Deepl Pro.
